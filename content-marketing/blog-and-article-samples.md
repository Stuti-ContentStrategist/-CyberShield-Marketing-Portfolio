Cybersecurity tools are evolving — but so are the mistakes organizations make while using them.\
Here are five common oversights that leave businesses vulnerable and how to avoid them with smarter practices.

**1️⃣ Ignoring Real-Time Monitoring**\
Many teams rely on periodic scans instead of live monitoring. Tools like **CyberShield Core** use AI to detect anomalies the moment they occur.

Thousands of alerts mean nothing if your team can’t prioritize. **CyberShield Insight** consolidates alerts into one dashboard with threat scoring.

**5️⃣ Manual Response Delays**\
Incidents that take minutes to respond can cost millions. Automation with predefined playbooks — built into **CyberShield Core** — saves crucial time.

> 🧩 **Takeaway:** Security isn’t just about having tools — it’s about using them intelligently and consistently.
