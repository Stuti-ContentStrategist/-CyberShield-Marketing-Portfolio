#### 💡 Best Practice Guidelines

✅ Keep subject lines under 50 characters for better mobile readability.\
✅ Personalize where possible (e.g., first name, company, or usage data).\
✅ Include one **primary call-to-action** per email — never more than two.\
✅ Maintain visual consistency — same logo, footer, and tone across all sends.\
✅ A/B test subject lines to measure engagement impact.

> 🧠 **Info:** Email marketing is storytelling in micro format — it relies on empathy, brevity, and timing as much as design.

These email frameworks ensure CyberShield communicates with clarity, consistency, and purpose — keeping users engaged at every stage of their journey
