#### 💡 Best Practice Guidelines

✅ Keep the grid simple — 4–6 points per table are ideal for readability.\
✅ Use outcome-driven phrasing (“reduce risk,” “increase visibility,” etc.) rather than feature-only terms.\
✅ Align internal documents (datasheets, guides) with the same key messages to avoid version drift.\
✅ Revisit the value grid quarterly to align with new releases and updates.

> 🧠 **Info:** A clear value proposition framework bridges marketing and documentation — ensuring every piece of content, from brochures to SDK docs, tells the same story with consistent positioning.
