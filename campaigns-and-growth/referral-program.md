# Referral Program

## 🧱 Overview

Turn your connections into rewards.\
Invite peers to experience CyberShield — and earn exclusive perks when they join.

***

#### 💬 Share Security. Earn Rewards.

Empower trusted users to spread the word.\
Each successful referral helps strengthen the global cybersecurity network while rewarding you for your advocacy.

***

#### ⚙️ How It Works

**1️⃣ Sign Up**\
Activate “Refer & Earn” in your CyberShield account — get your unique referral link instantly.

**2️⃣ Share Your Link**\
Send it through email, LinkedIn, or built-in sharing templates directly from your dashboard.

**3️⃣ Invitee Joins**\
Your contact activates a free trial or demo and gets a welcome email with quick-start setup steps.

**4️⃣ Earn Rewards**\
When they activate their license, you receive CyberShield credits, premium upgrades, or gift cards.

🧩 **Tip:** Keep sharing with context — referrals perform best when framed as _helping peers improve security_, not just earning rewards.
